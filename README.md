# npuzzle solver

A small java program to solve the given state of npuzzle game.
Description of the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle
The solution uses tree and graph search algorithms implemented in either BFS or DFS.
BFTSearch, BFGSearch, DFTSearch and DFGSearch files are tests for each implementation of search algorithms. You can also compare the efficiency of these algorithms by observing the number of steps leading to the solution and number of nodes generated while solving the initial state.
